When a converged electron beam is scanned across a thin sample, beam–sample interactions scatter the incident wavefunction, encoding phase shifts that reveal structural information.
Reconstructing these scattering sources at high resolution from intensity-only measurements of the transmitted probe presents a challenging high-dimensional inverse problem.
Modern experiments record the full diffraction pattern of the converged beam at each scan position, producing four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) datasets that capture both real-space and reciprocal-space information for structure determination, strain mapping, orientation analysis, and atomic-resolution diffractive imaging.

This mini-tutorial introduces participants to open-source Python software for simulating and analyzing 4D-STEM data.
Interactive tutorials use MyST Markdown and Jupyter notebooks, allowing participants to continue using materials after the session.
We will guide participants through dynamical electron scattering simulations using Bloch-wave and multislice formalisms, and provide experimental 4D-STEM datasets for multi-scale analysis.

Participants will learn to:

- Understand imaging and diffraction principles in STEM.
- Perform multislice simulations of atomic-resolution STEM and 4D-STEM experiments.
- Simulate dynamical electron diffraction patterns using Bloch-wave methods.
- Analyze nano-beam 4D-STEM datasets for strain and orientation mapping.
- Apply diffractive imaging methods—including center-of-mass imaging and ptychography—for phase retrieval and atomic-resolution structure determination.
