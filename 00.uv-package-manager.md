## Installation

We will use the excellent [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager to install and manage the open-source Python packages we will use.
First, we need to install it &mdash; see detailed installation instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Unix systems
:sync: tab1

The simplest way is to use the standalone installer:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

or, if your system doesn't have `curl`, you can use `wget` instead:

```bash
wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

If you're on a mac and prefer to use `Homebrew`, you can use:

```bash
brew install uv
```

:::
:::{tab-item} Windows
:sync: tab2

The simplest way is to use the standalone installer:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

If you prefer, you can use `WinGet`:

```bash
winget install --id=astral-sh.uv  -e
```

## Install Packages in Virtual Environment

To get started, we create a virtual environment, install the `mystmd` tool (optional), and install our packages.

```bash
uv venv
uv tool mystmd
uv pip install -r requirements.txt --compile
```

That's it!
If everything worked you should be good to go.
In order to run any commands inside the virtual environment, simply preface with `uv run`, e.g. to launch a local jupyter kernel you would use:

```bash
uv run jupyter lab
```
