The first step in simulating STEM measurements is to specify the electrostatic scattering potential of the sample.
In the simplest case we will consider in [](#scattering_potentials_page), namely the independent atom model (IAM), this is fully specified by the coordinates and chemical symbols of the atoms in the sample.

We will use the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) package to manipulate and visualize atomic models of the samples we will simulate.

## Periodic unit-cells

The main object of interest in `ase` is the `Atoms` class, which defines a collection of atoms.
At a minimum, this can be constructed by passing:  

- an array of `N` atomic positions in cartesian coordinates with shape `(N,3)`
- a list of `N` atomic numbers (or equivalently atomic symbols)  
- a specification for the periodic unit-cell the atomic coordinates reside in
  - e.g. a 6-element list describing the cell lengths $(a,b,c)$ and angles $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$

E.g. to create a model for the N$_2$ molecule, we could use

```python
N2_molecule = ase.Atoms(
    positions=np.array([[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]]),
    symbols=["N", "N"],  # "N2" also works
    cell=[6.0, 6.0, 6.0, 90, 90, 90],  # [6.0,6.0,6.0] also works
)
```

Or the more complicated case of the Si$_3$N$_4$ crystal structure:

```python
Si3N4_crystal = ase.Atoms(
    "Si6N8",
    scaled_positions=[
        (0.82495, 0.59387, 0.75),
        (0.23108, 0.82495, 0.25),
        (0.59387, 0.76892, 0.25),
        (0.40614, 0.23108, 0.75),
        (0.76892, 0.17505, 0.75),
        (0.17505, 0.40613, 0.25),
        
        (0.66667, 0.33334, 0.75),
        (0.33334, 0.66667, 0.25),
        (0.66986, 0.70066, 0.75),
        (0.96920, 0.66986, 0.25),
        (0.70066, 0.03081, 0.25),
        (0.29934, 0.96919, 0.75),
        (0.33015, 0.29934, 0.25),
        (0.03081, 0.33014, 0.75),
    ],
    cell=[7.6045, 7.6045, 2.9052, 90, 90, 120],
    pbc=True
)
```

We can visualize `Atoms` objects along various 2D planes using the `abTEM.show_atoms()` function.

## Orthorhombic super-cells

We can now use our periodic unit-cell to construct larger "super-cell" structures by tiling along the unit-cell directions.
In `ase` this is simply achieved by multiplication of the `Atoms` object.
E.g. `Si3N4_crystal * (2,3,1)` would return a new `Atoms` object by tiling the unit-cell twice along the first cell vector, and thrice along the second cell vector.

The multi-slice algorithm we'll use to simulate STEM measurements requires structures with orthorhombic cells, and thus before we tile our hexagonal unit-cell we need to transform it to an orthorhombic one.
`abTEM.orthogonalize_cell` is a very convenient function for doing just that.

```python
Si3N4_orthorhombic = abtem.orthogonalize_cell(Si3N4_crystal)
Si3N4_orthorhombic *= (3,2,17)
```

Here, we are using a (3,2,17) tiling of our orthorhombic unit-cell.
This ensures the in-plane cell size is larger than 20 Å x 20 Å, which is usually a safe size to prevent wraparound errors due to periodicity.
We choose the tiling along the beam direction to be 17 unit-cells, giving a total thickness of 2.9 Å * 17 = 49.4 Å, i.e. about 5 nm.

## Ice-embedded Biological Proteins

### PDB Atomic Models

To perform electron-scattering simulations with biological proteins, for example for single-particle analysis (SPA) cryoEM, it's customary to start with "biological assembly" files form the [protein data bank](https://www.wwpdb.org/).

We use the `gemmi` package to load the `8rqb.pdb1` file for an apoferritin molecule.

```python
# load PDB file
structure = gemmi.read_pdb("data/8rqb.pdb1")

# initialize xyz coordinates list
xyz_list = []

# loop over biological assemblies
for n_asu in range(len(structure)):
    model = structure[n_asu]
    residues = [res for ch in model for res in ch]
    xyz = np.array([[np.append(atom.pos.tolist(),atom.element.atomic_number) for res in residues for atom in res]])
    xyz_list.append(xyz)

# convert to numpy array and reshape
xyz = np.array(xyz_list)
xyz = xyz.reshape((xyz.shape[0],) + xyz.shape[2:])
```

We can then convert this xyz array into an ASE atoms object and plot its projection along of the symmetry axes:

### Continuum Ice Embedding

Note this is in vacuum.
However, in order to preserve the structure of the proteins during imaging, we often plunge-freeze them in vitreous-ice.
The vitreous ice also scatters with the electron beam, and thus it must be modelled.

Here, we use a very simple continuum embedding model described in @https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2012.04.021.
Essentially, we assume a functional form for the vitreous-ice density as a distance away from the surface of the protein, and assign that to the mean inner potential of ice, ~3.6V.

:name: apo_solvent

:::

We can now compare our apoferritin potential before and after embedding using the continuum solvent model.
We can see that the regions near the protein-ice surface, is at a negative relative potential, with respect to the vitreous ice background.
This has important implications in regularization during phase-retrieval methods for SPA &mdash; namely that we can't use a positivity regularization.
